This has some code based on the QT examples, as such i'll be licensing it as LGPL, i'll clean things up and put a proper set of files here for someone to read when i get even close to a release, until then, email me at "simcop2387 at simcop2387 dot info" if you have any questions

Plasma Applet Template
---------------------

You need KDE 4.2

-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/applet/is/installed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS .. 
make 
make install

(your $KDEDIRS is where you install your KDE 4)

Restart plasma to load the applet 
kquitapp plasma
plasma

or view it with 
plasmoidviewer YourAppletName

You might need to run kbuildsycoca4
in order to get the .desktop file recognized.
